# Project 1

This repository contains all finalized programs in project 1 produced in a collaboration between [Lasse](https://github.com/lasselb87), [Nicolai](https://github.com/nicolossus), and [Kristian](https://github.com/KristianWold).

### Contents

[main.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project1/main.cpp) is the main program, and contains the algorithms (General Algorithm, Optimized Algorithm, and LU-decomposition Algorithm) used for solving the one-dimensional Poisson equation. The computational performance of the algorithms is explored by clocking the CPU time of each algorithm for a various number of grid-points as well as finding the relative error between a known closed-form of the Poisson equation and the numerical approximation to it.

[PlotResults.py](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project1/PlotResults.py) visualizes the output files from main.cpp.

All data produced in this project can be found in the [Results folder](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/tree/master/Project1/Results).

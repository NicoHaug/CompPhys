This repository contains programs made for project 2 produced in a collaboration between [Lasse](https://github.com/lasselb87), [Nicolai](https://github.com/nicolossus), and [Kristian](https://github.com/KristianWold).

### Contents

[jacobi.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project2/jacobi.cpp) contains an eigenvalue solver which use the Jacobi rotation method, and have the accompanying header file [jacobi.h](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project2/jacobi.h)

[bucklingBeam.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project2/bucklingBeam.cpp) contains the code for solving the buckling beam problem using the Jacobi rotation method. To compile type `make bucklingBeam`. To run type `./bucklingBeam.x`

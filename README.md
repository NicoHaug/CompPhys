# FYS3150 Computational Physics I

Repository for projects in FYS3150.

### Project 1

[Project 1](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/tree/master/Project1): This project explores three different numerical algorithms for solving the one-dimensional Poisson equation recast as a tridiagonal matrix by discretization. The first algorithm, labeled “General Algorithm”, use the Gaussian elimination procedure and backward substitution as described by the Thomas algorithm. The second algorithm, labeled “Optimized Algorithm”, is an optimalization of the General Algorithm by specializing it to the specific matrix spawned by the discretization of the Poisson equation. The third algorithm, labeled “LU-decomposition Algorithm” use the built-in LU-decomposition procedure in the C++ library Armadillo. The subject of particular interest in this project is the computational performance of the algorithms.

### Project 2

[Project 2](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/tree/master/Project2): In this project an eigenvalue solver based on the Jacobi rotate method is developed. The solver is tested on the equations of a buckling beam and Schrödinger’s equation for two electrons in a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator well, recasted as eigenvalue problems by discretization.


### Project 3

[Project 3](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/tree/master/Project3): In this project we developed a model simulating the motion of the planets in the Solar System by using the Verlet method to integrate Newton's equations of motion.

### Project 4

[Project 4](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/tree/master/Project4): In this project we simulate phase transitions with the Ising model in two dimensions. We use the Monte Carlo method known as the the Metropolis algorithm to calculate Ising model estimations.

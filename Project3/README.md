# Project 3

This repository contains programs made for project 3 produced in a collaboration between [Lasse](https://github.com/lasselb87), [Nicolai](https://github.com/nicolossus), and [Kristian](https://github.com/KristianWold).


### Contents

The [Classes](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/tree/master/Project3/Classes) folder contains the object-oriented code modelling the Solar System.

The [Results](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/tree/master/Project3/Results) folder contains all the results produced in this project.

The [Raw_Data](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/tree/master/Project3/Raw_Data) folder contains all the raw data from which the results are generated from.

**Solved Problems**

To compile and reproduce all results run `python3 automation.py`

[twoBody.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project3/twoBody.cpp) solves the Earth-Sun system.

[benchmark.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project3/benchmark.cpp) benchmark the CPU times.

[test.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project3/test.cpp) contains unit tests verifying the object-oriented code.

[escapeVelocity.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project3/escapeVelocity.cpp) finds the escape velocity of Earth and contains code for studying closed orbits.

[threeBody.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project3/threeBody.cpp) solves the Earth-Jupiter-Sun system

[allPlanets.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project3/allPlanets.cpp) solves the motion of all planets in the Solar System

[relativistic.cpp](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS3150/blob/master/Project3/relativistic.cpp) finds the precession of the perihelion of Mercury
